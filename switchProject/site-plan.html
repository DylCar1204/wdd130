      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/ef3e36-17bebb-2e282a-edb88b-ece2d0" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/ef3e36-17bebb-2e282a-edb88b-ece2d0</a>

        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Rubik  <!-- change this --> I chose this one because it is a nice font that would work with the theme of the website.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Open Sans  <!-- change this --> I chose this font because it is a pretty simple and non-distracting font that can be used in paragraph form. 
      </h4>

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will be an introductory page to the website. It will contain links to find the games that are all on the website, and it will also have a brief overview of the purpose this website was created. The purpose of this website is to help people come to a conclusion as to whether a game (as shown on the website) is a good fit for the viewer’s interest. I may or may not contain an “about the author”-like section on this page as an introduction to myself.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Game Page</h3>
      <p>
        Review
        Each game page will include either a personal review written by me, or it will have a review from someone else (with permission and referencing, of course). This review will be a simple review of the game; it will include good things and bad things of the game, and the overall experience of the game. In this same section, an included portion that showcases more notable reviews (5 star reviews) from higher, more popular, reviewers (IGN, MetaCritic, etc.) showing a more in-depth variety to each review.
        Alongside the written review, I will likely add a video review from one of the more popular reviewing groups. This video will be either an in-website video, or it will be a link to another website.
        Images/Videos
          On the page for each game, there will also be a “gallery” section which will include, as the title suggests, images (and potentially videos) for each game.  It will have screenshots from the game, most likely from the game developers themselves (Nintendo, most often), and videos (most likely the trailers) which will either be added on to the website itself, or it will be linked to another website. This will be determined by the difficulty of knowing how to implement videos onto a website.
        Similar to Section
          I will include a section that will describe any related games, if any, so that the customer might be able to find a connection between games. I know that this was very helpful for me in knowing which games I really wanted to play, as I would have had a good experience with a game closely related to the game in-question. These similar games will likely have links to them on other websites, so they can learn more about these related games as well, if the viewer so desires.
        Purchase
          There will be another section on each page that will contain purchase information for each of the games. These will likely be more well-known stores, like Amazon, Target, Walmart, Gamestop, etc.. If I learn how to embed certain items on a website, it may be able to include a live-price for the item based on its store’s website. Regardless of whether or not I can embed things, there will be a link on how purchases can be made.
        Game Information
          Next, I will include a section where I can see the information for each game. This is more for the technical things, like file size, average game length, amount of players, etc.

      </ul>
      <h3>Coming Soon Page</h3>
      <p>
        On this page, I will include a list of games that have not released yet. There will be an image for it, and the title next to the image, each in separate boxes. This will help to organize the page a bit better, but will have sufficient information to be recognizable.      </p>

        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        On this home page, I will include a list of games that will open a new website. Not all may be functional, as there will be quite a few options, but I will differentiate which ones are functional or not.

      <h3>Game Page</h3>
      <p>         
        This is the bulk of the info. I will include all the information as described above on this page for every game that will be submitted in this assignment.

      <h3>Coming Soon Page</h3>
