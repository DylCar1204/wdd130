          Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
          Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River
          of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of
          folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of
          the river that they never left.
        </p>
        <p class="Text" id="p2">
          Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear
          and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is
          also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the
          sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain
          when needed.
        </p>
        <p class="Text" id="p3">
          Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is
          one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free
          flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early
          summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are
          good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim
          tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

        <p class="Text" id="dp1">
          Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate
          land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river
          and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and
          great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from
          from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and
          boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence
          of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater
          opportunities.

        <p class="Text" id="dp2">
          Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
        </p>
        <p class="Text" id="dp3">
          Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This
          designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the
          canyon tells.

          This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all
          river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
        </p>
        <p class="Text" id="cp2">
          Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
          breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience.
          The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but
          with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
        </p>
        <p class="Text" id="cp3">
          CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The
          rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to
          accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
          However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating
          scale, so we often refer to both.
